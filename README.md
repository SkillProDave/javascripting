# javascripting
Hi.  FYI: I ran into a great deal of techical problems (all solved now):
  - my Vagrant VM was denying me access to the Lighthouse git repos due to "Permission denied (publickey)".  I emailed support@lighthouselabs.net as well as admissions@lighthouselabs.com looking for help, but my email address (Dave@SkillPro.com) is apparantly blocked from the support@lighthouselabs.net address. It took a few hours, but I resolved it on my own by manually by generating a new SSH Key in the Vagrant VM and then adding that manually to my GitHub account & re-executing all the git commands in the console
  - My local git repo would not sync with my GitHub counterpart for the NodeSchool Javascripting excercises (summary: had to do with the default version of Node being incompatable).  Again, I resolved on my own by updating my version of Node & then re-cloning the NodeSchool Javascripting git (however, still had a number of navigation bugs to work out as it installed it in the wrong directory (lighthouse/javascripting/javascripting). However, this does not seem to be affecting my progress now.
  
These issues slowed me down quite a bit, so I've included a few additional .js files in this repo to demonstrate some of my previous background and work with JavaScript:
  - Udemy-Complete-Javascript-Course-My-code.js
  - Advent-of-Code.js
  - Experiments.js
